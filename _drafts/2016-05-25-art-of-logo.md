### The Black Book

So, I went to the library and got a bunch of books on graphic design. I got like 5 books that weighed a total of 80 pounds. I got this one book that was interesting, because it's just an encyclopidia of logos. Each page has about 12 different logos and also little exerpts describing their functionality. This goes on for over 300 pages. So, that's a lot of logos. Now, when you scoure a book with 1000s of logos you start to notice some things. The first thing that happens is your mind starts to categorize logo creation into a few basic methods which relates to this next thing. A lot of these old designs from german manufacturing companies and italian publishing firms look kinda like contemporary logos, like more than you would think. But I guess that makes sense. There's only so many ways to be creative
