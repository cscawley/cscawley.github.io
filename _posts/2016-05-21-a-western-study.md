### Contextual Scrap

My oldest scrap of contextual film study notes is a piece of paper that simply says 'Western Studies' followed by 4 blocks of chicken scratch. It's hard to read and filled with dependent clauses, but in those blocks of seeming nonsense are the most definitive threads of the Western genre. 

I've read several books that go to great lengths explaining the importance of the Western. Not only is it important to the history of America, but it's important in it's periodic re-emergance. There's a coorelation to the tempermant of the American people.

But this note wasn't taken out of any book. It was taken out of a screenwriting class from one of the most talented pitchmen I've ever met. Thats what makes these lines so simple yet so true to the core of an entire genre. A talented screenwriter will take a 500 page story and demand to know what is the singular element of this story? Why is it being told? After beating the hell out his or her work they can extract single golden lines and tell you with deft ease, this is what the story is and this is why it's so god damn good. Thanks Hafed.

### 'Western Studies'

1. Here society tends to be organized around `codes of honor` rather than a rationalistic systems.
2. There is an `abstract law` where people have no social order larger than their immediate peers, family, or even themselves alone.
3. Popular perception centers Westerns around the life of a wandering `nomadic` character.
4. The nomadic wanderer is reminiscent of early European tales of the knight errant, `Sir Gawin and the Green Knight`.
5. A deserter hiding out in a foreign battlefield. Amidst the chaos he has the ability to write his own rules.
