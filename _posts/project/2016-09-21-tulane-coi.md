I charged through The Great Raceway. I ran and speed and thundered through it, past my enemy, under the bad signs. I relinquished all thought tied down to feeling; I let it all go. I knew nothing but the race. No sight could see what I saw. No bullet small enough to find me. All that was, were hands on a wheel. A seal wanted my head, but I was even faster than God’s touch. No holy fallen being could stand in my way, all because I was on The Great Raceway.

I might return when I’m tired or I might go 10 more laps.

The words turned green and flew off the signs. Time stood still every 3 feet, because I was moving 8 feet faster than time’s pressure on space. All places are no longer places when you move beyond restrictions of space. A god will trap you in space and time, but he wont know what to do when the film cells open up and out you come, moving in a faster and faster gait. Freezing your god in astonishment, here you come, a ballad of freedom, singing raw notes to the tune of new worlds.

All this occurred on The Great Raceway.
