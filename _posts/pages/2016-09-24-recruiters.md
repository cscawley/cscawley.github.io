## Recruiters

Please use this website as a resource to understand the type of projects I've worked on and decide if I'm a good fit for the position you need to fill.

Keep in mind a few things before you pursue me further. I can't relocate, so we have to work with the New Orleans tech market. That being said I know what I'm worth and I wont compromise my price because of this market. If tech companies in this town want to grow and modernize their application development, cool, let's talk. 

Make sure to check out my [portfolio](http://chriscawley.com/portfolio) for examples of my work.
