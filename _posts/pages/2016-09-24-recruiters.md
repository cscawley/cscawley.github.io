## Recruiters

Please use this website as a resource to understand the type of projects I've worked on and decide if I'm a good fit for the position you need to fill.

I charge:

$500.00 for an updated PDF copy of my resume.

$20,000.00 for my current salary, social security number, or copy of my drivers license.

I'm very happy with my position at Tulane, but I'm always interested in hearing about new companies, startups and places where the leadership team is interested in innovating development, development operations, or systems architecture.

Check out my [portfolio](http://chriscawley.com/portfolio) for examples of my work.

Please make payments in the form of bitcoin: 14Afng73sd1A5j6Uwf3sj1pNqYsgEUr6dr

All the best,

Chris
